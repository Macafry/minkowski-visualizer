    <h1>Shapes as sets</h1>
    <h3>Basic Idea</h3>
    <p>
        We can think of a shape as a subset of the plane such that it follows some conditions. 
        Take for instance a circle centered at the origin of radius $r$. 
        We can define it as $\{x,y \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x^2 + y^2 \le r^2 \}$.
        <figure>
            <img src="images/centeredCircle.png" width=80%>
            <figcaption>Circle of radius $\sqrt{5}$.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        Even if it's not centered at the origin, we can define it as 
        $\{x,y \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid (x-k)^2 + (y-h)^2 \le r^2 \}$, 
        where $k$ and $h$ are the horizontal and vertical offsets respectively.

        </figure>
    </p>
    <h3>Generalizing the idea</h3>
    <p>
        In general, as long as we can express a shape as a bounded region, we can define a set for that shape. 
        But this begs the question, how do we express polygons as sets? 
        - Well let's remember that we can triangulate any polynomial into triangles. 
        So, if we can express any triangle as a set, we should be able to express any polygon as a set as well.
        We can define a basic triangle as $\{x,y \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid 0 \le x \le y \le 1 \}$.
        <figure>
            <img src="images/setTriangle.png" width=80%>
            <figcaption>Basic triangle as a Set.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        Then we can apply affine transformations to get any kind of triangle. 
        Once we do that for every triangle that triangulates the polygon, take their union to get the set for the original polygon.
