    <h1>About this Project</h1>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>This website was created as a creative project for my Math 3120 course. 
        I selected a mathematical concept (Minkowski Sum and Difference) and produced something creative around it. 
        In this case, I decided to manifest my creativity through a website with an interactive tool that helps develop some intuiton for Minkowski Sums and Differences.</p>
    <h3>Design Choices - Convex hull</h3>
    <p>
        For this visualizer I decided to let the convex hull of a set of points represent a shape as it's more computationally effcient. 
        An efficient algorithm is very important considering this is an interactive vizualizer. 
        Another reason for which I decided to use the convex hull is that it allows for a bruteforce algorithm. 
        This is particularly nice as, given my time constraints, I couldn't learn about an effcient algorithm to compute these operations. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To calculate the convex hull of a set of points I relied on <a href="https://andriiheonia.github.io/hull/">Andrii Heonia's library</a>.
