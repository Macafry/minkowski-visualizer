    <h1>Minkowski Operations</h1>
    <h3>Minkowski Sum</h3>
    <p>
        The Minkowski Sum operation is defined on <a href="setshapes.html"> sets that represent shapes</a>. Let $S_A$ and $S_B$ be shapes in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
        Then, the Minkowski Sum is the a set defined by the rule $\operatorname{Minkowski Sum}(S_A, S_B) =\{a + b \mid a \in S_A \wedge b \in S_B \}$.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another way of defining the Minkowski Sum is as the codomain of the map $f\colon S_A \times S_B \to \mathbb{R}^n$ with the rule $f(a,b) = a + b$.
        That is, the set of all points that can be expressed as a sum of an element of $S_A$ and an element of $S_B$.
    </p>
    <h3>Minkowski Difference</h3>
    <p>
        There are two ways to define Minkowski Difference: as the inverse operation to the Minkowski Sum or as a similar operator where we change adittion for subtraction. 
        We'll use the latter definition. So, $\operatorname{Minkowski Difference}(S_A, S_B) =\{a + b \mid a \in S_A \wedge b \in S_B \}$. 
        A nice result of the Minkowski difference is that $\vec{0} \in \operatorname{Minkowski Difference}(S_A, S_B)$ iff $S_A$ and $S_B$ intersect.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Proof.</em> Assume $\vec{0} \in \operatorname{Minkowski Difference}(S_A, S_B)$, that is, $\exists a \in S_A  \wedge b \in S_B$ such that $a-b=\vec{0}$.
        Then, $a=b$, so $a \in S_B$ as well. As $a \in S_A$ and $a \in S_B$, $a \in S_a \cap S_B$. 
        As there is an element in the intersection, the intersection is not empty, so they do intersect. This proves sufficiency.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now assume $S_A$ and $S_B$ don't intersect, that is, there's no element $a$ such that  $a \in S_A$ and $a \in S_B$. 
        However, the only way to get $a-b=\vec{0}$ is when $a=b$. But, no element exists in both $S_A$ and $S_B$ for that to be possible.
        Therefore, $\vec{0} \notin \operatorname{Minkowski Difference}(S_A, S_B)$. This proves necessity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, $\vec{0} \in \operatorname{Minkowski Difference}(S_A, S_B)$ iff $S_A$ and $S_B$ intersect.$\blacksquare$

    <h3>Applications</h3>
    <p>
        The most useful application can be found in videogames. 
        In videogames developers need to check for the collision of hitboxes, that is, if two hitboxes intersect. 
        When the bounding boxes are n-d cubes, the collision check is pretty simple. 
        However, if the shapes are much more complicated but convex, 
        then the Minkowski Difference allows for a pretty neath alogirithm to detect if two convex shapes intersect, 
        called the GJK algorithm.

        <br>
        We can also use Minkowski Sums to define some Visual Graphics operations mathematically. We can define a round corners operator by the rule
        $\operatorname{Round Corners}(S_A,r) = \operatorname{Minkowski Difference}(\operatorname{Circ}_r, S_A)$. 
        Where $\operatorname{Circ}_r$ is a circle with radius $r$ centered at the origin.
        <br>
        <br>
        We can also define the elongate operator by performing the Minkowski Sum between a shape and a line segment of the desired elongation length and elongation direction.
